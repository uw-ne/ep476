# Term Project Description

The purpose of this project is to practice many or all of the scientific
software development skills that you will learn in this course.  The best
projects will require you to use many different skills.

All projects are expected to require at least the following skills:

* version control
* software development in some language, while employing best practices for:
  * naming variables, methods and classes
  * modularity and reuse of the code
* testing
* documentation

I will form teams of 3-5 people from within the class based on a number of
factors, and those teams will work collaboratively towards a software project
to solve a particular type of physics or engineering problem.


## Timeline

### February 13: [Project proposal](https://classroom.github.com/a/U0BdoYro) (5%)

In 300-500 words, describe what your project will entail and the scope of your
contribution.  You should include the set of skills that you think this
project will require you to demonstrate.

### March 13: [Project timeline](https://classroom.github.com/a/g_EZgWgs) (5%)


Provide a detailed timeline for completing your project.  Break the project
down into a series of tasks and identify when you will aim to complete each
task.  Estimate how many hours of your time it will take to complete each
task.  Identify when your project will require feedback from others in order
to continue making progress.

### April 10: Intermediate report (5%)


Provide a status report of each of the tasks identified in your timeline.  Be
prepared to discuss possible changes to your timeline to accommodate the
current status.

### May 6: Presentation of project progress (5%)

Brief presentations of projects to include:

* scope of project
* assessment of progress vs. timeline
* demonstration of course skills

### May 11: Final status (20%)

All contributions will be complete and final assessment will occur based on
progress to this point.
