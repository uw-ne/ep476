Process for defining semester-long group work:

#. students propose problems in physics that they are interested in solving

   #. pull requests to private repo (LO: interacting with git/github)

#. instructor collects these problem and selects 2-3 (including instructors
   idea as backup)

   #. assign teams based on student interest (& strengths?)

#. discuss high level design elements for each problem

   #. similarities and differences

   #. scope and depth

#. walk through the design process for each problem

#. walk through division of labor for each problem

#. assign specific problem elements to each student

#. detailed design during class time

   continue....
